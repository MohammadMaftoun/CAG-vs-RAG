üìò Context-Aware Generation (CAG) vs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This repository explores Context-Aware Generation (CAG) as a next-generation alternative or addition to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Both are powerful paradigms designed to improve the factual accuracy, relevance, and adaptability of language models‚Äîyet they take fundamentally different approaches to knowledge injection.

üß† What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines pretrained language models with an external retrieval element. When a query is given:

    A retriever fetches relevant documents from a large corpus (e.g., Wikipedia).

    The generator (such as BART or T5) uses those documents as input to generate an answer.

RAG enhances factual grounding but can be limited by:

    Retrieval latency

    Irrelevant or outdated documents

    Lack of deep contextual adaptation

üåê What is CAG?

Context-Aware Generation (CAG) shifts the paradigm by focusing on infusing persistent context into the generation process. Instead of querying a database per prompt, CAG maintains a richer, more dynamic context over sessions, tasks, or interactions, and uses it to:

    Guide model outputs

    Improve coherence across turns

    Adapt to user preferences and evolving goals

CAG can be implemented through techniques like:

    Context window optimization

    Hierarchical memory integration

    Persistent embeddings or task-specific adapters


| Feature          | RAG                                        | CAG                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Knowledge Source | External documents (retrieved at run-time) | Persisted and integrated context/memory  |
| Latency          | Higher (due to retrieval)                  | Lower (no need for external search)      |
| Adaptability     | Static corpus                              | Dynamic and user-specific context        |
| Use Cases        | QA systems, factual recall                 | Assistants, dialogue agents, personal AI |
| Challenges       | Retrieval quality, scaling                 | Memory management, hallucination risks   |
